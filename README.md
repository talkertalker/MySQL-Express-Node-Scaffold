# MySQL-Express-Node-Scaffold
A repository of boilerplate code to get you started on simple projects using Express.js as a backend, MySQL as a relational database, and Node.js as your environment. You can host your static files from the client directory.

#### Note: If you are having trouble getting your server connection started, remember to alter the MySQL connection information in the app.js file. You will need to put in your own MySQL DB server information.
