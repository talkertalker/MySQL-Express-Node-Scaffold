# MySQL-Express-Node-Scaffold
A repository of boilerplate code to get you started on simple projects using Express.js as a backend, MySQL as a relational database, and Node.js as your environment. You can host your static files from the client directory.

#### Note: If you are having trouble getting your server connection started, remember to alter the MySQL connection information in the `app.js` file. You will need to put in your own MySQL DB server information.

## To download:

`git clone https://github.com/talkertalker/MySQL-Express-Node-Scaffold`

## To install dependencies,

navigate into the project's root directory and type:

`npm install`

## To run locally:

`npm start`

## To serve static files:

If you have HTML files or other static files that you want this server to serve, put them in `MySQL-Express-Node-Scaffold/client`

You can also run scaffolding applications like create-react-app or vue-cli and use this directory as your front-end home directory,
#### but make sure that your build paths are all correctly updated when you build and/or deploy your server.
